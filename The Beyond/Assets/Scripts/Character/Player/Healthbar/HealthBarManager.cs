// We have a Canvas set to World Space which we place this component on
// Each Character has a health script, and we call AddHealthBar on this (via a Singleton instance)
// This clones a prefab and attaches it to that character's health, so the healthbar follows the character around the world.
// HealthBars like all UI components are rendered in sibling order, so we sort them in our Update every frame.

// The healthbar prefab provided is a simple black rectangle with a smaller red rectangle isnide which changes size, as the meter.
